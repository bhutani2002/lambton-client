        question: "How does a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle work?",
        answer: "A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) seamlessly combines the power of a gas engine with the efficiency of electric motors. While the hybrid battery recharges on the go, to get the full benefit of a plug-in – including increased electric-only driving range – the vehicle needs to be recharged from the power grid.",

        question: "How does a battery electric vehicle work?",
        answer: "A battery electric vehicle (BEV) is powered entirely by a battery and single or dual electric motors. Like all electric vehicles, BEVs can also recharge their batteries to a limited degree through regenerative braking. To achieve a full charge, BEVs need to be plugged in.",

        question: "Are Toyota electrified vehicles as safe as a conventionally powered vehicle?",
        answer: "Toyota’s hybrid electric systems are designed and tested for Canada just like any Toyota vehicle, and adhere to Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. HEVs, PHEVs and BEVs cause no greater concern for passengers or rescuers in the event of a collision than non-hybrid vehicles. The batteries are sealed in a protective metal case and insulated from the vehicle body. Additionally, hybrid electric battery cables are shrouded in bright-orange cladding as a warning to emergency workers, and Toyota works closely with first responders to provide information and material for training on how to work with hybrid electrics.",

        question: "Do Toyota electrified vehicles require additional maintenance?",
        answer: "Not only do Toyota hybrid electric vehicles follow the same maintenance schedule of every 6 months or 8,000 KM (whichever comes first), but the way the hybrid electric system works may reduce how often other areas of the car need servicing. Depending upon how the vehicle is driven, in a hybrid electric, the engines are off some of the time, the brakes are regenerative, saving pad & rotor life, there is no transmission fluid under load, and there are no starters, alternators or belts to be replaced.",

        question: "Do I need to change my driving or refueling habits with a Toyota electrified vehicle?",
        answer: "Drive a Toyota hybrid electric vehicle like you would any typical conventionally-powered vehicle. Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive system works seamlessly in the background, optimizing the combination of gas and electric power as you drive. Fueling a Toyota hybrid electric vehicle is identical to fueling a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle; you do not need to plug it in. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles offer the benefits of a hybrid electric, with the option to plug the vehicle in for extended electric-only range.",
